### [Phase-1-project](https://github.com/MosingiA/phase-1-project)
The Big Five in Kenya is a single-page web app that highlights Kenya’s most iconic wild animals—Lion, Elephant, Buffalo, Leopard, and Rhinoceros—celebrated for their majesty and conservation importance. Users can explore detailed animal cards, search for species by name, and discover the best safari destinations across Kenya.

Uniquely, Kenya is the only country in the world with a national park inside a capital city—Nairobi National Park—offering a surreal experience of wildlife against a city skyline. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app retrieves and displays animal data asynchronously from a local json-server.
